This pipeline reads in the S. cerevisiae genome file in .gff format and create a fasta file with the sequence for each gene that has a verified orf.  The .gff file is downloaded from yeastgenome.org.  Initially, the file is parsed to create a FASTA data file and and a file of the table: fasta.fa and table.txt. Genes with verified open reading frames are extracted from table.txt.  For each of these genes the following information: chromosome, start position, end position, strand (+/-),and Name; is saved in the file: verified_genes.txt. The information from verified_gene.bed, is used to extract the sequence data from fasta.fa, and saved in the file verified_fasta.fa

Software needed for pipeline: Unix/Linux to run .sh (or through third party software run on Windows), packages used: Fastx_toolkit and bedtools
